Purpose of this repository is to code basic Http server, controllers approach, and basic DI. And maybe more...

There should be some simple app, like task list, with basic UI.

Backend should be written by hand - Http Server, DI, Controllers with Middlewares, and other required stuff.

So basically - basic fullstack application based on AspNetCore... without actual dependency on AspNet.
